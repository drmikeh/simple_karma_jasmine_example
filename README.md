# Simple Example of Configuring Karma and Jasmine

This example shows how to configure Karma and Jasmine for unit testing
without the use of Grunt or Gulp. Included here is the following:

* A package.json file that specifies the NodeJS libraries for running Karma and Jasmine.
* A sample Karma configuration file: karma.conf.js
* A sample Bash script for running Karma: run_karma

# What you will need to do

* Copy the package.json, karma.conf.js, and run_karma files to your project.
* Edit the karma.conf.js file and specify your paths and JavaScript files (look for the TODO comment).
* Run "npm install" to install the libraries specified in the package.json file
* Write your test specs
* Run your test specs via "./run_karma"
